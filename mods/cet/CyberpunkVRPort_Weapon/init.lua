-- CyberpunkVRPort_Weapon -- "bullet from the weapon barrel" VR aim.
--
-- The F10 weapon-aim toggle selects controller 6DoF (Hand Aim) when enabled and HMD 3DoF
-- (Decoupled VR Head Aim) when disabled. BOTH launch from the live weapon muzzle, so nothing here
-- depends on which one is selected.
--
-- The aim ENABLE toggle lives in the VR imgui overlay (dxgi "Controls" -> "Bullet from weapon
-- barrel", writes shared[58]). This script:
--   1) installs the GetOrientation VMT instrument once (InstallVRProvInstrument) -- this ALSO
--      installs the override hooks that redirect the shot down the barrel (slot 33 / mode 6),
--   2) publishes the weapon muzzle world orientation each frame (SetVRMuzzleQuat) -- drives both
--      the launch override and the overlay barrel laser dot, and
--   3) publishes the live camera zoom (SetVRZoomLevel) for DIAGNOSTICS ONLY -- never use it to
--      scale the dot or the projection: MAIN's projection already carries the ADS magnification,
--      and applying both double-zooms ordinary weapons, and
--   4) VR MOTION MELEE: detects a real controller swing (weapon moved fast relative to the player)
--      and fires the game's NATIVE melee attack along the blade via redscript PlayerPuppet:VRMeleeSwing
--      (mod CyberpunkVRPort_Melee). The native box-sweep does collision/damage/reaction/stamina, so
--      it behaves like the flat game. A fast swing = power/cleave. No-op for guns (self-filtering).

-- ONE DEBUG SWITCH FOR THE WHOLE PORT, read from shared slot [156].
--
-- The plugin republishes the launcher's DEBUG checkbox there every frame, so this bridge obeys the
-- same switch as everything else and can be flipped without editing a file. It used to be a
-- hardcoded `local DEBUG = true`, which is how one session left 26 449 lines and 5 MB of per-frame
-- state in this mod's log alone.
--
-- Cached for a quarter second: this is called from onUpdate and a shared-memory read per frame to
-- decide whether to not log is a poor trade.
